# Wordpress x Autz.org

Before starting, make sure that you already have an App in Autz.org. If not, you can [create one](https://autz.org) for free.

After creating app, please note the App ID and App Secret. We will need these value.

## How to install

Make sure you already have wordpress running on your local/server.

2. Login to your wp-admin, and upload the `autzorg.zip` plugin. (Plugins > Add new Plugin > Upload Plugin).

3. Activate the "Autz.org" plugin from the Installed Plugins menu. Then click Manage.

4. Put your App ID then click Save Changes. (You can [create an App](https://about.autz.org/p/docs) first, if you don't have it).

Now, please try to logout and see the new login page will be added with Autz.org Login button.
